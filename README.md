# EncryptOS
Official EncryptOS daemon, settings, updater and manager for the EncryptOS operating system.

# Building by source
You can easily build the EncryptOS app easily. Run this only on linux distributions and typically only an arch based instance, or EncryptOS.

`yarn start`
then building can be:
